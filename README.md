Repository for TOP recipes's project

This project will be made with the basic HTML and Git / GitHub knowledge I've been learning in the past week. Also, some command line knowledge will be used as well.

TOP is a really intuitive and complete learning path for those who want to learn how to code starting from scratch (my case).
