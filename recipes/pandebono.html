        <li class="p">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) 10 minutes before baking.</li>
        <li class="p">Process the queso costeño with the help of a blender or food processor until it is pureed, remove, and reserve in a bowl.</li>
        <li class="p">Separately, in another bowl place the yucca starch, cornstarch, sugar, and baking powder and add this mixture to the cheese previously reserved, add the egg and knead vigorously until it has a smooth consistency, add milk if required, this depends on the humidity of the cheese.</li>
